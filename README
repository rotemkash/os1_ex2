This program runs in a loop, 10 times. each run starts after the user hits enter.
then the user has one second to enter a positive numberif the user enters a number 
the program prints it then it loops again.if the user doesn't manage to enter a 
number in one second the program print "):".After the program is done it prints how many
numbers the user managed to enter and the maximum number the user entered.

In this program the father gives birth to a child. 
Before it gives birth to a child, it sets a signal handler that will be 
activated when the signals SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2 are sent to the process.
Now in an infinite loop each of them: 
a.Goes to sleep for a random amount of time of at most 2 seconds.
b.Grills a number between 0 and 100 including 0 and including 100.
c.If he grills a thousand numbers >= 95, he announces: I win, 
sends the SIGUSR1 signal to the second process and finishes.
d.If he grills sixty thousand numbers < 55, he announces: I lose, 
sends the SIGUSR2 signal to the second process and finishes.
Each of the two processes in the signal handler performs:
A. If received SIGUSR1 notifies: congrats! Shows how many 
numbers >= 95 and how many numbers < 55 is the grill and finishes.
B. If received the SIGUSR2 informs: thanks! Shows how many 
numbers >= 95 and how many numbers < 55 is the grill and finishes
possible race modes between the father and son:
1: the father wins or loses and completes all the prints then it exits the program.
2: the son wins/loses and completes all of it’s prints, kills the process and exits.
3: the father and son win/lose at the same time so one of them prints
“I win”/ “I lose” but doesn’t get enough time to kill the process so
 other one prints and kills the process
